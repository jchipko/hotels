# hotels

In this project, I analyze free form text reviews of hotels collected from Datafiniti. The dataset can be found [here](https://data.world/datafiniti/hotel-reviews) and includes the hotel location, name, a rating from 1 to 5, the review, and more. Using this data, I try to identify the common characteristics - location, cleanliness, customer service, amenities, etc - cited in reviews of 5 star hotels to figure out what makes customers rate a hotel highly. 

## Conclusion

From the initial analysis, I can tentatively conclude that cleanliness and customer service are important for customer satisfaction in the hotel space. However, this analysis can be improved by using more advanced deep learning techniques to extract information from the text and expanded by analyzing lowly rated hotels.
